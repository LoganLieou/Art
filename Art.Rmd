## Interactively Visualizing Highly Complex Relational Datasets

I can't even talk right now this is just so pretty just look at it. This is a force network which interactively visualizes, highly complex relational data, I may be able to use the same library / method to visualize something like a neural network or other data sets in the future but for now just wow.

```{r, context="render", echo=FALSE}
library(networkD3)

# Load data
data(MisLinks)
data(MisNodes)

# Plot
forceNetwork(Links = MisLinks, Nodes = MisNodes,
            Source = "source", Target = "target",
            Value = "value", NodeID = "name",
            Group = "group", opacity = 0.8)
```

This right here is just art + data, I don't know what else to say just look at it wow my actual brain so much serotonin.
